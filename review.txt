- assign_new_daily, assign_new_weekly and assign_new_monthly are a code smell, can’t we pass the time period in as a param? Or at least refactor that code to reduce repetition.

- Not sure using cookie_store and storing the logged in user in the session is secure. Would need to Google it. I usually use a gem for auth, like devise.

- The whole “#{timeframe}_exercise” thing is a code smell, and 9/10 it turns out a better idea to normalise it into a relationship.

- Your ScorecardsController update action isn’t secure: I have to be logged in, but I can still change any scorecard. There’s no check it belongs to me. Same with reset.

- UsersController show doesn’t check you’re who you claim to be.
